# SvelteKit + Paraglide Setup

This covers wiring **Paraglide JS 2.x** into a **SvelteKit 2.x** project running **Svelte 5** (runes era). Paraglide is compiler-based and key-authored: there is no extraction step — you author messages directly into `messages/{locale}.json` and call the generated `m` functions. This file sets up the build plugin, server middleware, routing, and a language switcher; the per-edit authoring rules live in `references/languages/js-ts/libraries/paraglide/code.md`.

## Scope

- **In scope:** SvelteKit (SSR/adapter-based) projects only.
- **Out of scope (v1):** Plain Vite + Svelte SPAs (no SvelteKit). Paraglide works there, but the request-scoped SSR locale resolution, `reroute`, and `hooks.server.ts` wiring below are SvelteKit-specific. Do not apply this file to a non-SvelteKit Svelte project.

### Version targets and legacy notes

- **Primary target:** SvelteKit 2.x + Svelte 5 + Paraglide 2.x.
- **Svelte 4** works with Paraglide 2.x but is not the primary target — the language-switcher component below uses Svelte 5 runes (`$props`, `$derived`); on Svelte 4 rewrite it with `export let` / `$:` reactive statements.
- **SvelteKit < 2.3:** the `reroute` hook was added in `@sveltejs/kit` 2.3.0, so it is absent on 1.x and on early 2.0–2.2. **Recommend the user upgrade to SvelteKit ≥ 2.3** before proceeding — without `reroute`, URL-based locale routing requires a different (deprecated) approach this file does not cover. Hard-stop and ask before continuing on SvelteKit < 2.3.
- **Existing Paraglide 1.x (`@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit` adapter):** Paraglide 2.x replaced the dedicated SvelteKit adapter with the framework-agnostic `reroute` + `handle` model shown here. If the project has `@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit` installed, this is a **migration**, not a fresh setup — flag it to the user, remove the old adapter, and re-wire using the hooks below. Do not run both in parallel.

## Packages

Paraglide ships as a single package. The ICU MessageFormat plugin is **not** an npm dependency — it is loaded at config time via a CDN module URL in `project.inlang/settings.json` (see below), so do not `npm install` it.

**Detect the package manager first.** Check for a lockfile in the project root: `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `bun.lockb` / `bun.lock` → bun, `package-lock.json` → npm. Use the detected manager for the install command.

**Example (npm):**

```bash
npm install -D '@inlang/paraglide-js@^2'
```

Equivalents: `pnpm add -D '@inlang/paraglide-js@^2'`, `yarn add -D '@inlang/paraglide-js@^2'`, `bun add -D '@inlang/paraglide-js@^2'`. The caret is single-quoted so zsh's `EXTENDED_GLOB` does not eat it.

### The `sv add paraglide` scaffold — reconciliation

`npx sv add paraglide` is the vendor's canonical scaffold and will wire most of the files below for you. **It is not the default path here** because:

1. It pins `@inlang/paraglide-js` to its own caret range (e.g. `^2.15.2`), which may not match this repo's `^2` pin convention — so the pin still needs reconciling afterward.
2. It defaults to the **non-ICU** `@inlang/plugin-message-format`, not the ICU MessageFormat 1 format this skill family standardizes on.

So the **default path is the manual wiring below**, under pin control. The `sv add` route is allowed only as a documented pinning **exception** (mirroring the `@lingui/swc-plugin` exact-pin exception in the repo CLAUDE.md): if you run `npx sv add paraglide`, you MUST afterward (a) edit `package.json` to pin `@inlang/paraglide-js` to `^2` and reinstall, and (b) swap the message-format plugin in `project.inlang/settings.json` to ICU1 (replace the module URL and rename the plugin settings key) per the settings section below. If you are not going to enforce both, use the manual path.

## `project.inlang/settings.json`

Create `project.inlang/settings.json`. The ICU MessageFormat 1 plugin **replaces** the default `@inlang/plugin-message-format` — both plugins claim `./messages/{locale}.json`, so only one may be present. List **only** the ICU1 module:

```json
{
  "baseLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["en", "fr"],
  "modules": [
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inlang/plugin-icu1@1/dist/index.js"
  ],
  "plugin.inlang.icu-messageformat-1": {
    "pathPattern": "./messages/{locale}.json"
  }
}
```

- Set `baseLocale` to the project's source language and `locales` to every locale the project ships.
- The module URL is pinned to **`@1`** (a major), not `@latest` — keep it pinned per repo convention.
- `plugin.inlang.icu-messageformat-1` is the settings key the ICU1 plugin reads; `pathPattern` tells it where the flat per-locale catalogs live.

Then create the base-locale catalog with a sample ICU message. ICU1 catalogs are plain key → ICU-string maps with **no `$schema` key**:

```json
// messages/en.json
{
  "hello_world": "Hello, {name}!",
  "likes": "{count, plural, one {# like} other {# likes}}"
}
```

Only the base-locale file needs entries to make code compile; the other locale files are populated by the translation platform. (Authoring conventions — plurals, select, descriptive keys — are in `paraglide/code.md`.)

## Vite plugin

Add the Paraglide Vite plugin to `vite.config.ts` (or `.js`), alongside the existing `sveltekit()` plugin. Compiled output goes to `src/lib/paraglide/`:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { paraglideVitePlugin } from '@inlang/paraglide-js'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    sveltekit(),
    paraglideVitePlugin({
      project: './project.inlang',
      outdir: './src/lib/paraglide',
      strategy: ['url', 'cookie', 'baseLocale'],
    }),
  ],
})
```

The `strategy` array sets locale-resolution ordering — see "Locale and routing strategy" below for why `cookie` matters under SSR. Keep existing plugins in the array; just add `paraglideVitePlugin()`.

With `outdir: './src/lib/paraglide'`, the compiler emits `messages.js` and `runtime.js` under `$lib/paraglide/`, so import them as `$lib/paraglide/messages.js` and `$lib/paraglide/runtime.js` (keep the `.js` extension — that is what the compiler emits and SvelteKit resolves).

## `src/hooks.server.ts`

The server hook runs Paraglide's middleware around each request. `paraglideMiddleware` resolves the request's locale, stores it in request-scoped context (AsyncLocalStorage) so `getLocale()` and the `m` functions read it automatically, and hands back the localized request. The `transformPageChunk` callback rewrites two placeholders in the served HTML:

```ts
// src/hooks.server.ts
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { paraglideMiddleware } from '$lib/paraglide/server.js'
import { getTextDirection } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime.js'

const paraglideHandle: Handle = ({ event, resolve }) =>
  paraglideMiddleware(event.request, ({ request: localizedRequest, locale }) => {
    event.request = localizedRequest
    return resolve(event, {
      transformPageChunk: ({ html }) =>
        html
          .replace('%lang%', locale)
          .replace('%dir%', getTextDirection(locale)),
    })
  })

export const handle: Handle = paraglideHandle
```

If `src/hooks.server.ts` already exists with other `handle` logic (auth, headers), compose it with SvelteKit's `sequence()` rather than overwriting — show the user the merged version before writing.

**`%lang%` / `%dir%` are user-defined placeholder tokens**, not reserved Paraglide names. They must match exactly between the `.replace()` calls here and the `app.html` tokens below — the pair only works if both files agree. `getTextDirection(locale)` returns `'ltr'` or `'rtl'`.

## `src/hooks.ts`

The universal `reroute` hook strips the locale prefix from the URL before SvelteKit matches it against your routes, so you do not have to create a `[locale]` route directory. `deLocalizeUrl` maps a localized URL back to the canonical (de-localized) path:

```ts
// src/hooks.ts
import type { Reroute } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { deLocalizeUrl } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime.js'

export const reroute: Reroute = (request) => deLocalizeUrl(request.url).pathname
```

`reroute` requires SvelteKit 2.x — see the version note above if the project is on 1.x.

## `src/app.html`

Change the `<html>` tag to use the placeholder tokens the server hook rewrites. The HTML `lang` and `dir` attributes stay as attribute names; only their values become placeholders:

```html
<!-- src/app.html -->
<html lang="%lang%" dir="%dir%">
```

These `%lang%` / `%dir%` tokens must match the `.replace()` calls in `src/hooks.server.ts` exactly.

## Locale and routing strategy

The `strategy` array (set in the Vite plugin) is the ordered list of sources Paraglide checks to resolve the active locale per request. The recommended ordering is:

```ts
strategy: ['url', 'cookie', 'baseLocale']
```

- **`url`** — locale taken from the URL (e.g. `/fr/about`). This is what `localizeHref()` and the `reroute` hook operate on. Maps to **prefixed** routing.
- **`cookie`** — locale read from a cookie. **Required for SSR correctness:** on the first document request the server cannot read `localStorage` or `navigator.language`, so without a server-readable source the server would render the wrong locale and hydration would mismatch. The cookie gives the server a locale it can read on that first request. `setLocale()` (below) writes this cookie.
- **`baseLocale`** — final fallback to `baseLocale` from `settings.json`.

**Prefix vs. no-prefix routing** is governed by the strategy and Paraglide's URL patterns:

- With `url` in the strategy, non-base locales are served under a path prefix and the base locale stays unprefixed by default — `/about` (base) and `/fr/about` (French). The `reroute` hook de-localizes the prefixed path so your single set of routes serves every locale.
- To prefix **every** locale (including the base), or to customize the prefix shape, configure `urlPatterns` on the Vite plugin. The exact `urlPatterns` object shape varies by Paraglide minor — **look it up in the Paraglide docs for the installed version before emitting it**; do not guess the shape. If the user just wants the default prefix behavior, omit `urlPatterns` entirely.

If the user does not want URL-based locales at all, drop `url` from the strategy and rely on `['cookie', 'baseLocale']` — the locale then follows the cookie only, with no per-locale URLs.

## Language switcher

Create a small Svelte 5 component that switches locale and offers localized links. `setLocale()` updates the active locale (and writes the cookie used by the `cookie` strategy), and `localizeHref()` builds locale-correct hrefs:

```svelte
<!-- src/lib/LocaleSwitcher.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { locales, getLocale, setLocale } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime.js'

  const current = $derived(getLocale())
  const displayNames = new Intl.DisplayNames([getLocale()], { type: 'language' })
</script>

<nav>
  {#each locales as locale}
    <button
      onclick={() => setLocale(locale)}
      aria-current={locale === current ? 'true' : undefined}
    >
      {displayNames.of(locale) ?? locale}
    </button>
  {/each}
</nav>
```

Wire it into the root layout so it appears on every page:

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import LocaleSwitcher from '$lib/LocaleSwitcher.svelte'
  let { children } = $props()
</script>

<LocaleSwitcher />
{@render children()}
```

By default `setLocale()` reloads so the server re-renders under the new locale (correct under SSR). Use `localizeHref('/path')` for in-app links that should carry the active locale's prefix; see `paraglide/code.md` for the markup conventions. Style the switcher to match the project (the inline markup above is a baseline).

## `.gitignore`

The compiled output in `src/lib/paraglide/` is generated by the Vite plugin and must not be committed. Add:

```
# Paraglide compiled output
src/lib/paraglide/
```

## Verify

1. Start the dev server (`npm run dev` or the detected manager's equivalent). It should boot without errors and the page should render the sample message.
2. Switch locale via the switcher — the visible text changes and (with `url` in the strategy) the URL gains the locale prefix; reloading that URL keeps the chosen locale (cookie + URL persistence working under SSR).
3. Run the production build (`npm run build`) and confirm it completes — a missing or misconfigured `project.inlang/settings.json` surfaces here.

## Optional add-ons

If the user selected optional add-ons (coding-rules `@import`, CI/CD, test setup), apply the matching sub-steps from `references/languages/js-ts/libraries/paraglide/setup.add-ons.md`. Skip add-ons the user did not select; skip this section entirely if none were selected.

## Follow-up — not in v1

**Translator comments are not supported.** The inlang/ICU message data model has no comment, context, or description field, so there is nowhere to attach translator notes — see the "Translator comments" section in `paraglide/code.md`. The only disambiguation lever is a descriptive key name (`cart_remove_button`, not `remove`). A comment-bearing path is deferred to a future version; do not attempt to wire comment metadata into messages now.
